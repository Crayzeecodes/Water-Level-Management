# Water-Level-Management
WATER LEVEL CONTROLLER  8051 MICROCONTROLLER ASSEMBLY  LANGUAGE  PROGRAMMING

ABSTRACT :
This project addresses the common challenge of efficiently managing water levels in 
overhead tanks to prevent overflow and water wastage. Manual monitoring of water tanks can 
be inefficient and prone to human error, leading to resource wastage and increased 
operational costs. To address this issue, an automated water level control system was 
developed using the 8051 microcontroller programmed in assembly language. 
The system continuously monitors the water level within the tank using sensor inputs, 
triggering the water pump when levels fall below a specified threshold and turning it off once 
the tank reaches its maximum level. The 8051 microcontrollerâ€™s efficient handling of inputs 
and outputs enables reliable and real-time response to water level changes. The project was 
implemented and tested on the edsim51 simulator, validating the control logic and ensuring 
precise functionality. 
Key outcomes include a cost-effective, automated solution that reduces manual intervention, 
optimizes resource use, and prevents water overflow. This project demonstrates the 
applicability of microcontroller-based automation for sustainable water management in 
residential, agricultural, and industrial settings.
